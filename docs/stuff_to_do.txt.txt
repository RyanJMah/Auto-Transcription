Here is a non-comprehensive list of stuff that needs to be done to build this application:
    
    - simple/boring tasks the have to be done regardless:
        - test suite/software

    - back-end:
        - routine to read input file into a time-series array (pydub is kinda shit, might not be able to use it)

        - pre-processing routine
        - pitch detection routine
        - onset detection routine
        - post-processing routine
        - thresholding/peak-picking routine

        - stuff we need to figure out:
            - rhythm detection routine (might need AI for this one, or a lot of bullshit math)
            - tempo detection routine
            - key signature detection
            - time-signature detection routine (might also need AI for this one, or a lot of bullshit math)

    - front-end:
        - stuff we need to figure out:
            - what language to use?
            - what framework to use?
            - desktop app or web app or both?

            - routine to map time-frequency data to notated sheet music
                - is there a library for this somewhere?
            
            - GUI:
                - file explorer interface
                - display
                - the entire thing
